DW Directory Watch
password protect a directory on Windows OS. Implemented with AHK for my own private usage 
but I guess some of you out there could be searching for the same thing so share it without any garante

==History
I wish to protect some directories on my computer with juste a password. No need to hide or crypt it. 
And I search for such a thing without succes. Apparently no one needed it before so I have to make it.
if you want to know more about the genesis of this apllication, you can read the following thread:

==How to use
1) first place the application in a safe place where nobody but you kow, because of the ini File
2) Start the application. I would suggest to put a shortcut in the Autostart  folder of windows
3) Configure it in 3 steps
  - choose the target directory to be protected
  - enter your passwords et check if thy match (note it and save it carefully before!)
  - set a delay to be remembered after unlocking
4) Confirm et start the protection
5) take a break and let DW watch over your sensible directory.

 
==Wish
If you are a developper and would like to improve this application. You are welcome.
- I would like to make the protected folder unsearchable by windows by don't know how
- A system of password retrieval is also gut but
- And much more
